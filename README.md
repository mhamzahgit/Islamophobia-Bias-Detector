# Islamophobia-Bias-Detector
A Natural Language Processing(NLP) project to understand the bias in responses towards anti-islamic events between France and Iran, in specific under the lens of the Hijab Removal Trend, and the support for it internationally.



###Introduction:
With the recent events in France and Iran, regarding the issue of wearing the Hijab, which have caused a huge social resonance, i have decided to better understand the issue, with several Data Science techniques.  In this project I intend to explore the extent to which there is a bias towards wearing the hijab in social media in these two countries.

###Data Collection:
I will be using the twitter API, to collect data from tweets in France during the recent Hijab Laws that were passed (between 2010 and 2022) as well as scrape the current tweets with the situation of forced hijab in Iran. I plan to filter the data from the twitter API based on the time frame (2010 - 2022) and location (France and Iran) i have chosen to explore.

###Analysis being performing:
I will be comparing if there was a bias towards islamic values through the wearing of hijab, i.e when the anti-hijab rules were enforced in France, was there a majority support for it, and similarly, in iran when hijab is forced and the protests are going on whether there was an overwhelming support for removal of hijab. this will help to have another dimension of understanding if there was a bias towards islamic practices in peopleâ€™s opinions about these.e




###Model and Evaluation: 
I will be using supervised machine learning techniques using the following models, Naive Bayes,  Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model and Neural Networks. The reason I will be using multiple models is to achieve more accuracy  as well as compare the results between the different models.
For evaluation, I will be using various performance metrics such as accuracy_score, precision, recall and F1 score.
